# Usage

## Start dev server

Set `baseurl` value in the config - this should be changed to match the repo name. This makes it easy to mirror how sites [run on Github Pages](#run-on-github-pages).

```sh
$ make serve
```

Open the browser at:

- http://localhost:4000/jekyll-blog-demo/


## Build

```sh
$ make build
```

View the output in `_site` directory, which can then be served as a static site.
